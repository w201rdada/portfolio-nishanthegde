## Where have all the truck drivers gone?

The trucking industry is the lifeblood of moving goods around the country, representing 70 percent of the nation's freight volume by weight. Without enough trucks and drivers on the road, some combination of things is going to happen: Shipments will be delayed, and producers will have to pay higher prices to get goods to market.
