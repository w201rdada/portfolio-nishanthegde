# Automatic Script Parsing Tool

## Why parse scripts?

The success of an entertainment studio is based on finding content that is unique and original. This process usually starts with a script being pitched to a studio. It is normal for content creators to submit hundreds of scripts per week to a studio. If the studio likes what it sees, it greenlights the project and decides to fund it. 
The script is like the backbone of a movie or television series, and it forms a main storyline. They usually contain all details of the project, like dialogues of characters, setting of the scene, movements and actions of characters, and any other information that needs to be conveyed in addition to spoken content.
Script reading has traditionally been a manual process. Typically a group of executives will manually read a script and gauge what they think the potential market appeal of a project would be. They then make estimates on what the cost of production and bringing that piece of content to market is, and finally decide on whether the cost is worth the expected return. 
Due to it being a highly manual process, the script intake tends to be laborious, inefficient, slow, prone to error, and susceptible to human bias.

## Old School Hollywood meets Silicon Valley

Advances in NLP can change the way scripts have traditionally been evaluated. The application of Information Extraction (IE) methods can allow for the transformation of previously unstructured data into a dataset that can be reasoned with. IE will also facilitate the application of standardised tagging and annotation across scripts. The broad goal of IE would be to allow for the computation of extracted information from scripts so that this information could be logically reasoned with much like how we reason with a relational database.
An IE based solution would be an analytic framework that is built around the intake process. To maximize likelihood of success, scripts would need to have some kind of semi-structure around them and they would need to look similar to each other. 
This can be achieved by using industry standard templates. Writers would input elements of the script into these templates. They would still be given full creative freedom in terms of what text that they can enter, however,  the templatized input would allow algorithms to better pick up key features from the script. 
These templates would be fed to an algorithmic parsers that was designed to build a metadata dataset for the script that was fed to it. This dataset would include talent, scene settings, key actions and movements, assets used in the scene, and dialogue attributes. The metadata collection would power an application that collected it in a relational database. 
For cold starting the algorithms, a training dataset that was built using the input templates and human annotation could be used. This collection of training data would be much like  what the input process is now, except for the additional process of using an input template.
After a script is algorithmically parsed, a human touch layer would be necessary so that any information that the algorithm did not pick up, or picked up incorrectly, could be added or changed in this application. This application would be integrated into the overall  system architecture and different facets of the business would be able to benefit from having access to rich production metadata.

## A Work in Progress
If this venture is successful, it would be beneficial not only for studios, but for content creators, actors and talent, as well as other entities in this ecosystem.
The script intake process becomes more efficient since studios will be able to scale up the number of scripts they take in, thereby allowing them to make more strategic bets. This will also allow for a more efficient budget allocation and better estimation of production and marketing costs. Furthermore, studios will now be able to collect features prior to when a project come live, and relate these features to the performance of content. This will have a huge impact on studios being able to predict demand for their content even before content is made. 
Content creators and talent will also see benefit because of the sheer increase in the number of scripts that are being reviewed. Scripts that would have otherwise got lost in the manual process will have a better chance of surfacing since they can now get indexed. Studios will be able to associate production features, like settings in a scene, to expected success of content. This would allow them to ask for scripts to be tweaked so they they can have a better chance of being greenlighted. A script from a small independent creator that would have traditionally not qualified, would now be able to work with a studio to increase its chances of getting selected. 
A network of characters can be built from the automatic of scripts. The occurences of actors in a screen and the participation in dialogues can be recorded. This information could be tied to the success of a scene, thereby allowing for actors that would have traditionally not been placed together, to now be pitted in the same movie or scene. 
Financial lending specializing in funding entertainment projects can benefit as well. Since budget and production estimates would become better, capital can be more efficiently allocated towards new projects. 
There will be challenges along the way. I do not expect this to be a turn-key solution. The main challenge will be user adoption. Changing the way things have been done for almost a century is going to be difficult. Studios will have to drive this change since they have the most leverage in the ecosystem. Standardised input templates will have to be created so that some kind of semi-structure can be placed around the writing of scripts. Content creators will have to comply to standards and use these templates at the time of writing scripts. The pioneer tax will be high at first, but as more entities get on board, and the benefits become evident, the industry will embrace this model.
